# spatial-pooling-stack
A stack of spatial poolers to learn MNIST

This is an unsupervised feedforward neural network that uses a global column of cells to classify the input to the receptive field as being one of a set of features.

_At the moment there is just one layer in the pooling stack. I plan to fill the stack to the network can learn a hierarchy of features so to classify each image in MNIST._
